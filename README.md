# [A Food Recipe Website](https://sumusa.github.io/recipe-project/)

A simple HTML website showing recipes with ingredients and instructions on how to make selected meals.

## Lessons

For my first project, I gained foundational skills in web development and version control. I learnt how to create an HTML boilerplate, create directories and files, and navigate through the terminal. I also learned how to input headers, paragraphs, images, and links, and how to create ordered and unordered lists for my recipes. Furthermore, I learnt how to create Github repository, track changes, make commits using VScode terminal and write useful commit messages.

Importantly, I practiced organizing my code to be clean and beginner-friendly, ensuring that it is readable and understandable for any viewer. This experience gave me a strong foundation for future web development projects.
